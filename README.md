# GifImporter

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to essentially import gif images. It converts gifs to a spritesheet then adds the appropriate components.

A fork of this mod is also available [here](https://github.com/art0007i/GifImporter).<br>
This fork makes the generated sprite sheets into a almost square resolution, at the cost of some wasted space in certain cases.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [GifImporter.dll](https://github.com/kawaiiamber/GifImporter/releases/latest/download/GifImporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
